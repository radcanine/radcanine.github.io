  <figcaption> Commission for @SieggyEsperanto ! Super ambient and chill~â™¨ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦. I really liked the idea of drawing something on with an ambient background and pretty skylight. The slimes were a nice touch I think. Water took a while to figure out but I think overall this piece turned out just great.</figcaption>
